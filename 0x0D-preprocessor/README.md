# **Introduction to C Pre-processors**

- C Pre-Processor is not a part of the compiler but it's a step executed before code is compiled.

- The pre-processor can replace token in the text, insert contents of other files into the source file, or suppress compilation ofpart of a file by removing sections of texts.

- Pre-processor directives such as #define and #ifndef, are typically used to make source programs easy to change and easy to 
compile in different execution environments.

- All pre-processor directives begin with a pound sign (#).
