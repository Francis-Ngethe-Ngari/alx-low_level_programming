## **Introduction to Command Line Arguements in C**

### **argc**

- Argument Count is an integer variable that stores the number of command-line arguments passed by the user including the 
name of the program. So if we pass a value to a program, the value of argc would be 2 (one for argument and one for program name)

### **argv**

- Argument Vector is an array of character pointers listing all the arguments.
