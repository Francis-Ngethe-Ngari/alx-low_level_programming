## **Learning Objective: Recursions**

- **What is recursion?**

- Recursion is the process that comes into existence when a function calls a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem.
Any function which calls itself is called a recursive function, and such function calls are called recursive calls.
Recursion involves several numbers of recursive calls. However, it is important to impose a termination condition of recursion.
Recursion code is shorter than iterative code however it is difficult to understand.

### **TASKS**

### **Scripts**
#### **0-puts_recursion.c**

- Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);
